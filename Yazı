The main objective is to quantitatively investigate the effect of upstream duct inclination on wake development and aerodynamic losses at different inlet angles. A loss bucket curve is constructed in order to visualize the performance variations depending on the inlet angle in a systematic way. The MISES method uses a viscous/ideal flow coupled solution approach with an implicit Euler solver and boundary layer modeling.

A mesh resolution study is performed to evaluate numerical stability. The grid density is increased both in the flow direction and in the wall-normal direction, and the sensitivity is analyzed in terms of parameters such as blade surface pressure, boundary layer thickness, deflection angle and exit losses.

This study provides comprehensive insights into the interaction between inlet duct geometry and cascade aerodynamics and has practical implications for early stage turbomachinery design, especially under non-uniform inlet flow conditions.
